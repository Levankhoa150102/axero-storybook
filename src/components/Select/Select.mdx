# Select

A simple dropdown select component using the native HTML `<select>` and `<option>` elements, wrapped in a label container for accessibility and styling. Useful for forms and option pickers.


### Basic Select

The Select component includes a label and a styled container for accessibility:

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Default} />

## Styling

### CSS Classes

- `.axero-select-container` — Container for label and select
- `.input-label` — Label element (shared utility class used by the project)
- `.axero-select` — The select element itself

You can override or extend styles in `Select.css`.


## Selected Option

Shows a Select variant where one option is selected by default. Useful for demonstrating persistent selections and how the control highlights the chosen item.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.SelectedOption} />


### Disabling the Selected Option variant

If you want to disable `Selected Option`, add the class `dropdown-with-search--disabled` to the root element.


## Filter With Search

A searchable dropdown specifically designed for space filtering. Features a label, select trigger that shows the current selection, and when clicked reveals a dropdown menu with a search bar for filtering options in real-time.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.WithSearch} />

**CSS Classes Used (Filter With Search):** `.dropdown-with-search`, `.dropdown-with-search--disabled`, `.dropdown-with-search--open`, `.dropdown-with-search__container`, `.dropdown-with-search__trigger`, `.dropdown-with-search__value`, `.dropdown-with-search__icon`, `.dropdown-with-search__icon--open`, `.dropdown-with-search__menu`, `.dropdown-with-search__search-container`, `.dropdown-with-search__search-input-wrapper`, `.dropdown-with-search__search-input`, `.dropdown-with-search__options`, `.dropdown-with-search__option`, `.dropdown-with-search__option--selected`, `.dropdown-with-search__empty`

**Props:** `label="Filter by space"`, `options={[...]}`, `value="all"`

### Disabling the dropdown-with-search variant

If you want to disable `SelectWithSearch` or the dropdown-with-search UI, add the class `dropdown-with-search--disabled` to the root element. This applies disabled styles and prevents the menu from opening.
