# Rating Component

The Rating component provides an interactive star rating system for user feedback and display purposes. It supports both interactive rating input and read-only display modes, with full and half-star precision.

## Basic Usage (First-Time Vote)

This is the standard rating interaction for when a user has not yet voted on an item. It uses the default `star-on.png` and `star-half.png` images for interaction.

## Self Rating Mode (Re-voting)

This mode is used when a user has already submitted a rating and wishes to change it. It visually distinguishes the user's own rating by using the `star-self-on.png` and `star-self-half.png` images.
